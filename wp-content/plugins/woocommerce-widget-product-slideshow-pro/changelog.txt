Note it only works on 1. WPMU license option coming soon.
* Fixed: Use Relative File Path of image instead of using Image URL's. This fix is for  servers that have disabled URL file-access in parameter of getimagesize function.
* Fixed: Fixed conflict with WordPress Domain Mapping plugin - thanks to Johannes for access to his WPMU install to find and fix this issue.* Fixed: Change Pro Version plugin API call so that it only calls from the WP-Plugins page and not from every admin page.* Fixed: Changed Pro Version plugin API call so that if it calls once to the API and it does not connect it auto aborts instead of keeping on trying to call.
